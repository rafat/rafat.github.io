	  <h1> Multirate Systems and Filter Banks</h1>

	  <p>Multirate systems are systems that contain multiple sample rates. There
are a number of reasons why one may want such a system. Multirate may be 
needed to reduce computational needs of a system. Instead of ,say, N operations
per cycle the system may need N/M operations if the sampling rate is reduced
by M. It may also be needed to help reduce redundancy as in the case of multichannel
communications and M-band filterbanks.</p>

<h3>Decimation</h3>

	    <div align="center">  <img class="picture" src="../img/deci.png" />
		  <br \><p>Decimation Block Diagram</p>
	  </div>



<p>Decimation by an integer M corresponds to retaining every \(Mth\) sample and discarding</p>
\(M-1\) samples. In frequency domain, the output \( Y(e^{j\omega})\) is given by
\[
Y(e^{j\omega})=\frac{1}{M}X(e^{j\frac{\omega+2k\pi}{M}})
\]

for \(k=0,1,....,M-1\)

<p>Aliasing is an issue as downsampling ``stretches'' the bandwidth by a factor M. Applying
  the Shannon sampling theorem, the sampling frequency must be \(f_{s} > 2f_{max}M\) in 
  order to prevent aliasing.An example of aliasing is shown below. A signal consisting of two 
  sinusoids at 50Hz and 130Hz is originally sampled at 1000Hz. It is then downsampled by 2 and 5.
  In the first case \( f_{s} = 1000 Hz \) is greater than \( 2f_{max}M = 520 Hz \) and, therefore, no
  aliasing occurs. In the second case, \( f_{s} = 1000 Hz \) is less than \( 2f_{max}M = 1300 Hz \) 
  and we see higher frequency appearing at 350 Hz.</p>

		  <br \><p>Decimation Example 3</p>
	  </div>




<h3>Interpolation</h3>

<p>At its simplest, L-interpolation is the process of adding \(L-1\) zeros
between sample values of a signal \(x\).</p>

  	    <div align="center">  <img class="picture" src="../img/interp.png" />
		  <br \><p>Interpolation Block Diagram</p>
	  </div>


<p>In frequency domain, the output \( Y(e^{j\omega})\) is given by
\[
Y(e^{j\omega})=X(e^{jL\omega})
\]

   ``Imaging'' is a an upsampling phenomena that corresponds to aliasing
   in the downsampling case. Since an interpolator is compressing a signal,
   its images appear in the frequency band and depending on the interpolation
   factor we need a suitable low-pass filter (anti-imaging filter) to filter
   out these images. Shown below is an example of imaging after upsampling
   the signal from example above by a factor of 2.</p>

	  <h3>Polyphase Representation</h3>
	  <p>Consider a time series \(X(z)=\sum_{n= -\infty}^{\infty} x(n) z^{-n}\). We can use
	  the decimation by \(2\) idea and separate it into its even and odd coefficients.</p>

\[
X(z)=\sum_{n= -\infty}^{\infty} x(2n) z^{-2n}+z^{-1}\sum_{n= -\infty}^{\infty} x(2n+1) z^{-(2n)}
\]

<p>Let \(P_{0}(z)=\sum_{n= -\infty}^{\infty} x(2n) z^{-n}\) and \(P_{1}(z)=\sum_{n= -\infty}^{\infty} x(2n+1) z^{-n}\) then \(X(z)\) can be written as </p>
  \[
  X(z)=P_{0}(z^{2})+z^{-1}P_{1}(z^{2})
  \]
  
  <p>This idea can be extended to any value \(M\) instead of just \(2\).</p>
  \[
  X(z)=\sum_{n= -\infty}^{\infty} x(Mn) z^{-Mn}+z^{-1}\sum_{n= -\infty}^{\infty} x(Mn+1) z^{-(Mn)}+....+
  z^{-(M-1)}\sum_{n= -\infty}^{\infty} x(Mn+M-1) z^{-(Mn)}
  \]
  
  <p>This representation is known as polyphase representation and is used to implement efficient filter banks :</p>
  
  \[
  X(z)=\sum_{i=0}^{M-1} P_{i}(z^{M}) z^{-i}
  \]
	  

<h2>Filter Banks</h2>

<p> Low pass and High pass filters process the signal by allowing
   only specific frequencies to go through- low pass and high pass
   frequencies, respectively. This obviously serves a very useful purpose
   but if these filters are used together then with proper design they can
   also reconstruct the original signal. A filter bank is a system in which
   two or more filters are used together to analyze and process a given signal.</p>

     	    <div align="center">  <img class="picture" src="../img/twochannel.png" />
		  <br \><p>Two Channel Filter Bank</p>
	  </div>
   
 
  
<p>Figure above shows an example of a two channel filter bank. Analysis part
  of the filter bank decomposes a signal while the synthesis part reconstructs
  it. \(h_{1}(n)\) and \(h_{2}(n)\) are the low pass filters while \(g_{1}(n)\)
  and \(g_{2}(n)\) are complementary high pass filters. </p>
  
  <h3>Perfect Reconstruction property</h3>
  
  <p>Using interpolation and decimation frequency equations, the outputs at the
  two output nodes of analysis filters are 
  \(\frac{1}{2}(X(\frac{\omega}{2})H_{1}(\frac{\omega}{2})+X(\frac{\omega}{2}+\pi)H_{1}(\frac{\omega}{2}+ \pi))\)
  and \(\frac{1}{2}(X(\frac{\omega}{2})G_{1}(\frac{\omega}{2})+X(\frac{\omega}{2}+\pi)G_{1}(\frac{\omega}{2}+ \pi))\)</p>
  
  <p> After feeding these two outputs to the two input nodes of synthesis filter, we get( in z-domain)</p>
  
  \[
  Y(z)=\frac{1}{2}(H_{1}(z)H_{2}(z)+G_{1}(z)G_{2}(z))X(z) + 
  \frac{1}{2}(H_{1}(-z)H_{2}(z)+G_{1}(-z)G_{2}(z))X(-z)
  \]
  
  <p> For perfect reconstruction, we need \(Y(\omega)=X(\omega)\), this gives us two equations</p>
  \[
  \frac{1}{2}(H_{1}(z)H_{2}(z)+G_{1}(z)G_{2}(z))= z^{-L}
  \]
  
  and
  
  \[
  \frac{1}{2}(H_{1}(-z)H_{2}(z)+G_{1}(-z)G_{2}(z)) = 0
  \]
  
  <p> First equation is called the no distortion equation and the right hand term is a delay
  element. Second equation is the anti-aliasing equation and needs to be zero for Perfect
  Reconstruction Filter Bank to serve its purpose.</p>
  
  <h3>Orthogonal Filter Banks</h3>
  
  <p>Before discussing Orthogonal Filter Banks it is important to discuss orthogonality with
  respect to a filter \(h(n)\). In wavelet theory, double shift orthogonal filters play a very
  important role. A filter \(h(n)\) is double shift orthogonal if </p>
  \[
  \lt h(n),h(n-2k)\gt =\delta(k)
  \]
  
  <p>In the case of two channel filter banks, we can obtain the other three filters just by designing
  one filter and then using the orthogonality and Perfect Reconstruction properties. Because of double
  shift orthogonality, we can only design even orthogonal filters. It has been shown that for a given
  low pass filter \(h_{1}(n)\), the high pass filter can be obtained by alternating flip method, ie., 
  coefficients of low pass filters are flipped and then the sign of every alternate coefficient is flipped.
  The filters of synthesis filter banks can be obtained by using the no-distortion and no-aliasing equations
  of the Perfect Reconstruction property. It turns out that for a given \(N+1\)-tap low pass analysis filter \(H_{1}(z)\),
  the other three filters are</p>
  
    <p> High Pass Analysis Filter \(H_{2}(z) = -z^{-N}H_{1}(z)\)
  
  
  Low Pass Synthesis Filter \(G_{1}(z) = H_{2}(-z)\)
  
  High pass Synthesis Filter \(G_{2}(z) = -H_{1}(-z)\)</p>
  
  
  <h3> Biorthogonal Filter Banks</h3>
  
  <p> As has been mentioned previously, linear phase filter response is a desirable
  property in a number of applications and even with all their positives, Orthogonal
  filter banks are not linear phase filters. Only Haar filter bank is orthogonal and 
  linear phase. Biorthogonal filter banks consists of filters where the filters are not 
  orthogonal to themselves. They are constructed such that the analysis filters are
  orthogonal to the synthesis filters in addition to being linear phase. Using orthogonality
  and perfect reconstruction properties of biorthogonal filters, it can be shown that if given
  two FIR filters \(H_{1}(z)\) and \(G_{1}(z)\), the other two filters in the 
  biorthogonal filter bank can be constructed as
  
  \(H_{2}(z)= G_{1}(-z)\) and \(G_{2}(z)= -H_{1}(-z)\)</p>
