          <p>Wavelets are normalized,finite, short-duration, zero mean functions.
          
  $$\int_{-\infty}^\infty\psi(t)\,dt=0$$

          
  \(\psi(t)\) is also known as Mother wavelet as it can be dilated and translated
  to yield Child wavelets. Function to be analyzed is then processed with these
  Children  wavelets to yield wavelet coefficients.An example of a wavelet function
  is shown below. It is a Daubechies2 wavelet generated using Matlab.</p>

      <p> The Children wavelets are given by \(\psi_{k,s}(t)\) where the mother wavelet
   is scaled by s and translated by k.
   
   $$\psi_{k,s}(t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{s}}\psi(\frac{t-k}{s})$$
   
   The Wavelet Transform Wf of a function f(t) is computed by taking the inner
   product of function f(t) with the translated and dilated versions of mother
   wavelet.</p>

   <div class="math">Wf=<f,\psi_{k,s}>=\int_{-\infty}^\infty\!f(t)\frac{1}{\sqrt{s}}\psi^*(\frac{t-k}{s})\,dt</div>

   
      <p>For small values of s, \(\psi_{k,s}\) will be of shorter duration and higher
  frequency. For large value of s, \(\psi_{k,s}\) it will be more spread out in
  time and will consist of low frequencies. The fact that wavelet functions are
  bandpass functions ensures that we cannot cover the entire frequency spectrum
  just with the wavelet functions.To solve this problem, scaling functions \(\phi(t)\)
  are introduced. They are complement of wavelet functions and correspond to low
  pass filter in signal processing terms.</p>

       <p>Wavelet Transform, so defined, happens to be computationally unwieldy as
  translations and dilations can take any value. A better approach is to
  discretize translation and dilation steps. Mathematically, let \(s=a^{m}\)
  and \(k=a^{m}n\) where m and n are integers.</p>

  $$\psi_{m,n}(t)=a^{\frac{-m}{2}}\psi(a^{-m}t-n)$$
